\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of type `raw`.}

\item{split}{Sequence of bytes to use for splitting. Coerced by `as.raw` to a
`raw` vector if possible. Byte-sized `integer` and `hexmode` vectors are
valid.}

\item{cpp}{Setting to `TRUE` makes use of the C++ implementation.}
}
\value{
A list of the same length as the number of splits of the byte
  sequence.
